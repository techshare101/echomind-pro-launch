## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### If animations are choppy:
```css
/* Add to popup.css */
* {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

### If portal doesn't open:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify email is stored in localStorage
3. Test API endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://us-central1-echomind-pro-launch.cloudfunctions.net/api/createCustomerPortalSession \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

### If panels overlap:
- Clear cache and reload extension
- Check z-index values in CSS
- Verify `hidden` class is applied correctly
