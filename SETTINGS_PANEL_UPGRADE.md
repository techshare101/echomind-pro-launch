## 🔧 How It Works

### Panel Transition Flow

**Opening Settings:**
1. User clicks ⚙️ Settings button
2. Dashboard slides left + fades out (250ms)
3. Settings panel appears and slides in from right (280ms)
4. Total transition: ~530ms

**Returning to Dashboard:**
1. User clicks "← Back to Dashboard"
2. Settings slides right + fades out (300ms)
3. Dashboard appears and slides in from left (330ms)
4. Total transition: ~630ms

### Manage Subscription Flow

**User Journey:**
1. User clicks "💳 Manage Subscription"
2. Extension fetches portal URL from Firebase
3. Stripe Customer Portal opens in new tab
4. User can manage subscription directly with Stripe
5. Changes sync automatically via webhook

**API Call:**
```javascript
POST /api/createCustomerPortalSession
Body: { email: "user@example.com" }
Response: { url: "https://billing.stripe.com/..." }
```
