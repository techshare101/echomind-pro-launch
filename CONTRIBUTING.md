## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use strict type checking
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Define interfaces for data structures
- Export types from `src/types/`

### React

- Use functional components
- Use hooks appropriately
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks

### Styling

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes
- Follow cosmic theme color scheme
- Maintain responsive design
- Keep animations subtle and smooth

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ popup/          # React components for popup
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Reusable components
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # TypeScript definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ background.ts   # Service worker
â”œâ”€â”€ content.ts      # Content script
â””â”€â”€ styles/         # Global styles
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

3. Test edge cases:
   - Very long text
   - Special characters
   - Different languages
   - Offline mode
   - Model not available

### Browser Testing

- Chrome Canary (primary)
