- ✅ Popup processes AI requests correctly
- ✅ All AI APIs check availability before running
- ✅ View switching works (processing → home)
- ✅ Error messages are helpful and actionable
- ✅ Memory Vault saves/searches/deletes
- ✅ Test page ready for demos

**Full details:** See `PHASE1_CHANGES.md`

## 🎮 Core Flow (Now Working)

```
1. User highlights text on webpage
2. Cosmic menu appears near selection
3. User clicks action (Summarize/Explain/Simplify/Save)
4. Loading indicator shows on page
5. Popup processes via Chrome AI APIs
6. Result displays in popup Home tab
7. Automatically saves to Memory Vault
8. User can search/view/delete in Vault tab
```

## 🚀 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Install & Build (5 minutes)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Create Icons (2 minutes)

**Easiest method:**
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Set text to "E", background #6366f1
3. Download
4. Save 3 sizes to `public/icons/`:
   - `icon16.png` (16×16)
   - `icon48.png` (48×48)
   - `icon128.png` (128×128)

**Detailed guide:** See `BUILD_AND_TEST.md` → "Create Placeholder Icons"

### Step 3: Enable Chrome AI (5 minutes)

Open Chrome Canary and enable 4 flags:

```
chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model → Enabled BypassPerfRequirement
chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano → Enabled
chrome://flags/#summarization-api-for-gemini-nano → Enabled
chrome://flags/#rewriter-api-for-gemini-nano → Enabled
```

**Restart Chrome Canary**

### Step 4: Download AI Model (5-10 minutes)

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Run: `await window.ai.summarizer.create()`
3. Wait for model download
4. Verify: `await window.ai.summarizer.capabilities()`
   - Should return: `{ available: "readily" }`

### Step 5: Load Extension (1 minute)

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select `dist` folder
5. Pin EchoMind to toolbar

### Step 6: Test! (5 minutes)

Open test page:
```
file:///c:/Users/valen/Development/echomind/test/test-page.html
```

1. Highlight text
2. Click "Summarize"
3. Open popup
4. View result
5. Check Vault tab

**Full testing checklist:** See `BUILD_AND_TEST.md`

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build fails
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Extension won't load
- Check `dist/` folder has `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, etc.
- View errors in `chrome://extensions/`
- Rebuild: `npm run build`

### AI not available
- Verify Chrome Canary (not stable Chrome)
- Check all 4 flags enabled
- Wait for model download (can take 10 min)
- Test: `await window.ai?.summarizer?.capabilities()`

### Menu doesn't appear
- Refresh page after installing extension
- Highlight at least 10 characters
- Check console (F12) for errors

**Full troubleshooting:** See `BUILD_AND_TEST.md` → "Troubleshooting"
